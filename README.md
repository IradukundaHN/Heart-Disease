## Description:
With Heart Disease data, Classification with k-Nearest Neighbor(knn) algorithm is used to find k closest response values at a given value of the predictor variable and predicts the class that occured most frequently in the k observations. The model predicts the response (HeartDisease) with the categorical predicators (ChestPain and Age) from the Heart data. The logistic regression model is used to predict the probability that a randomly chosen patient will develop heart disease.

## Concepts:
1. Classification with K-Nearest Neighbor 
2. Logistic Regression Model - Odds
